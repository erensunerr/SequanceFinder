# SequanceFinder
Aritmethic and geometric sequance finder written in python3
How to use :
1.Number is your sequance's firstmost or a middle number.
2.Number is in the middle or in the endmost number.
How many numbers in between is how many numbers in between 1.num and 2.num
Arithmetic means by adding or subtracting; Geometric means by division or multipication


Examples:

Lets say we have an arithmetic sequance: 2,(1),(2),(3),10
To find the rule of the sequance 1.Number = 2;2.Number = 10; Numbers in between = 3 and 1 as the type of sequance.

Lets say we have a geometric sequance: 6,(1),24
To find the rule of the sequance 1.Number = 6;2.Number = 24; Numbers in between = 1 and 0 as the type of sequance.

You can also say there is no number in between by typing in 0.

To start:
Go to the directory. Way 1: chmod +x sequancefinder.py and ./sequancefinder.py Way 2: python sequancefinder.py
